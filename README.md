# Face Detector using CNN

A simple face detector (MD) trained from convolutional neural network (CNN).
Accuracy is as high as 98%

## Prerequisites
* [Python3](https://www.python.org/) (tested on Python 3.7.4)
* [TensorFlow 2.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/) (tested on 2.0.0)
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) (tested on 1.17.3)
* [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) (tested on 1.3.1)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) (tested on 3.1.1)
* Datasets (see DATA.SOURCE.md)

## Usage
Run `./run.sh` to learn a face detector

Note that the sample/test division is random, so the accuracy could fluctuate
